title: The Shell Script Example
description: An example of grading script using the testcase tool
instructions: |
    <h4>The problem</h4>
    <p>
        In this exercise you must implement a shell script tbat
        reads two numbers per line and calculates addition.
        All results that are greater than 10 should be limited to 10.
        Your script should print line per input line in format
        <code>a + b = c</code> where a and b are the given numbers
        and c is the result.
    </p>
    </p>
    <h4>Grading</h4>
    <p>
        This exercise uses utility <code>testcase</code> to do
        a simple multipart grading.
        In addition, we show how <code>stdio-diff</code> can be
        used to do simple input/output comparison.
        Unit testing should be preferred over input/output testing,
        though it does work for some cases.
    </p>
    <p>
        This pattern is good when you have multiple simple programs
        that do the actual grading and you like to gather the data
        to multiple files. Tool <code>testcase</code> has similar
        internal parts as <code>capture</code>, thus it will take
        care of the environment security for example.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember to check project README and <code>run.sh</code> for more information.
